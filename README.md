# Cpp-project

Inherit Equation.cpp in our own derived classes. 
Implement the virtual functions in Equation.cpp.
The function which overloads output operator needs to print the output in the specified format as per your assigned task.
Only string will be given as inputs in our derived classes.. rest needs to be handled by your own implementation.
This will ensure that your code works individually also.
Also do not forget to make a "parse" condition for your own task.
